# Aspire Test API


## Brief documentation

### Assumed logic

- authenticated users allows to apply a loan 
- All the loans will be assumed:
    - to have a `weekly` repayment frequency.
    - the loan have default status is `approved`
- user must be able to submit the weekly loan repayments:
  - which wonâ€™t need to check if the dates are correct
  - just set the weekly amount to be repaid.
  - user can only repaid owner loan
- after repaid all loan's amount, the loan repayment_status auto change to `yes`. 
  I used Event/Listener to update, this should be queued for better but this will make you more cost for setup environment

### Directory structure
Basically, I apply the recommended code base structure of Laravel framework and add the below directories:
- Event
- Exceptions
- Http
    - Request: All validate will execute in here
    - Resources: Reformat object/collection before return to client
- Listener
- Repositories:
  - Including interfaces which fetches or create Model objects
  - Should use Collection approach to fetch multiple Models
- Rules: Use when validate Requests
- Services
  - Including logic which uses Application
  - Not allowed to call the classes in Infrastructure directly
  - May use Interfaces which are defined inside Application
